# Homework 4: Investigate "Peeking"

In this homework assignment, we attempt to implement the cluster and contrast peeking method. 
## Task 1
The first task of this homework was to implement an AHA distance function for Nums and Syms and for each row, print the row item, it's nearest item and the distance between them, and its furthest item and the distance between them. The runtime of this is ____ and can be found at [test/lua/hw4.lua](https://github.com/foleycolin00/SinlessCSA/blob/hw4-lua/test/lua/hw4.lua). 

An example of the output: 
```
Row 14: {rainy, 71, 91, TRUE, 50, 40}
Closest: {rainy, 65, 70, TRUE, 4, 10  Distance: 0.16495721976846}
Furthest: {sunny, 85, 85, FALSE, 10, 20  Distance: 0.90267093384844}
```
## Task 2
The next task given was to show the derivation of the cosine rule. That can be seen here: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89092830/134360525-14f2d5b8-d40b-4bfa-934b-6c94c0fb090b.png

## Task 3
The last task given was to complement the faraway function by implementing a div1 function that does one random based on two distant points, and a divs function that does many random projections, dividing the data down to sqrt(n) of the data. The runtime for this is ____ and can be found at [test/lua/hw4.lua](https://github.com/foleycolin00/SinlessCSA/blob/hw4-lua/test/lua/hw4.lua).

An example of the output:
